📊 Discount Analysis Project
Is Discount Growing or Hurting the Business?

📌 Project Summary
This project analyzes the impact of discounts on business performance.
The objective is to understand whether discounts are helping increase growth or damaging profitability.
Using sales data, I analyzed how discount percentage affects revenue, profit, and profit margin across time and categories, and provided business recommendations.

This project is created as part of my Business Analyst portfolio.

🎯 Business Problem

Discounts are commonly used to increase sales.
However, excessive discounting can reduce profit margins and lead to long-term losses.

Main Question:
